I installed a plugin for Flickr. It can embed photos and sets.

Check out these tags, and [learn how to use

## Flickr images

Two examples of embedded images:

{% flickr_image 2947909854 m center "This is a medium picture of a Zebrafink" %}
{% flickr_image 2947909284 z center "This is a large picture of a Zebrafink" %}

## Flickr sets

One example of medium-size set:

{% flickr_set 72157600500316094 m nodesc %}
